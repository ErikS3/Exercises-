The link that I chose is an article from the Washington Examiner.  The article consists of individual profiles of each of
the 2016 Presidential candidates.  In each profile, there are various, factual components such a candidate's education, 
birthplace, and policy positions.  This information could be better structured using rows and columns.  For example, the	
first row could consists of different categories including the candidate's name, party affiliation, policy positions, and
the other components.  Of course, the columns will be filled with these facts.  This information would be very useful to 
a reporter because it provides key information regarding every candidate in the presidential race.  As a result, reporters 
have a quick, straightforward guide that gives them every major detail they need to know about the 
cadidates.
